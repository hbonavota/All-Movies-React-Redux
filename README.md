# About the proyect

<p>
The main objective of the project was that we learn to solve the different problems without using external libraries, and doing it with "react classes", without using the HOOKS that are clearly more functional, but that the scope of the project sought to learn the life of the components in react with Classes like these ->

```
componentDidMount ()
componentDidUpdate ()
componentWillUnmount ()

```
and saving the favorite movies in the
```
window.localStorage
```
in addition to the state Redux.
